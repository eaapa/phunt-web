I Know Where

We love discovering interesting locations. We want to be outside and challenge each other to find places where whe've been.
We made a mobile app to match our passion and it's called I Know Where.

It works like this.

When you start up I Know Where you get to browse pictures of locations and their rough distances to your location. 
When you find a pictured location in real life, verify the spot via the app.
After that a timer starts within which time you will _have to_ take a new picture. 
When you upload the new picture you become the owner of that picture chain.
The time limit depends on the category and is either 15, 30 or 100 minutes.

Of course you can also start your own picture chain and get to choose the time limit of your picture chain yourself.

I Know Where is fully functional and here's how it looks:
